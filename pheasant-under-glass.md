# Pheasant Under Glass

## Ingredients

* 1 whole large pheasant breast, split and boned
* 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* 6 dried morels, brushed off
* 2 large shallots, peeled and chopped
* 2 large white mushrooms, wiped clean, trimmed and sliced thin
* 2 tablespoons brandy
* 1/3 cup dry white wine
* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 1 1/2 teaspoons chicken demi-glace
* Pinch cayenne pepper

## Preparation

* Flatten pheasant breasts slightly with a mallet or rolling pin, then rub with 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice and season with black pepper.

* Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter over medium-high heat in a 9-inch skillet. When it foams, sear the pheasant, skin side down, about 5 minutes per side. Remove to a plate, cover and keep warm.

* Steep the dried morels in 1/2 cup hot water for about 5 minutes. Drain and strain, reserving the soaking liquid. Discard stems and slice caps thinly.

* Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in the skillet and saute the shallots for 2 minutes, until golden, then add the morels and mushrooms for 1 minute. Remove to a bowl and keep warm.

* Boil the reserved soaking liquid with the brandy and white wine until reduced by 1/2, about 1 minute, then whisk in the cream and demi-glace and boil about 1 minute, until sauce is thickened and smooth. Whisk in the remaining lemon juice and the cayenne.

* Place the pheasant breasts skin side up on hot serving plates and top each with half the mushroom mixture, then the sauce.

* Enclose each breast with (ideally) a glass cover. Alert your guests to the olfactory possibilities, so they don't blow the experience the way I did. Once they are seated and you have their attention, lift the cover and fan the essence toward them, if necessary.
